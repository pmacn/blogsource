So I managed to stay on [Octopress](http://octopress.org) for about 2 days and just couldn't quite get used to it. There was just too much friction with every little thing I wanted to change, which is most likely contributable to my lack of experience with the Ruby landscape.<!-- read more -->

I was managing to get stuff done and would surely have gotten the hang of it sooner or later. But I moved on.. because there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  
And it's all better now. I'm sitting in the warm fuzzy glow of [DocPad](http://docpad.org) with my choice of.. everything.  
There will most likely be posts and stuff.

The fact that the site is being built from scratch however means that the site will evolve over time and the look and feel might change quite frequently for a while.

It could also be that I just really like moving, after all we have moved 5 times in the last 4 years and there's gonna be at least one more before too long.
