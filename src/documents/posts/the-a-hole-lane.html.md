I moved to a new town a few years back and within the first couple of weeks I came upon what I came to call the A-hole lane.
 
Picture an intersection with two lanes going your direction; Then shortly after the intersection the right lane ends and has to merge into the left lane. My immediate reaction to this was that anyone who came up in the right hand lane was a jerk.<!-- read more -->
 
This was an intersection where you might sit through a few light changes (which is quite rare in a smaller town) and going through the right lane usually meant you didn’t have to. You would also pass quite a lot of people.
 
For quite a long time I always went in the left lane, actually most people would stay in the left lane and it was rather rare to see more than a few cars in the right one.
 
But after a while it started to dawn on me that everyone piling up in the left lane was limiting throughput in the intersection; We were only utilizing half of our bandwidth. Sure, it all merged into one lane on the other side but the right lane went on long enough to accommodate quite a lot of cars and the bottleneck was always the intersection.
 
So from that day I started to always go into the right lane whenever there was more than a few cars in the left lane, sometimes even waiting for all cars in the left lane to pass before merging if needed.
 
And I’m hoping to this day that my decision was a rational one and that I didn’t just turn into an a-hole.
