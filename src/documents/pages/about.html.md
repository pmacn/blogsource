My name is Peter MacNaughton and I've worked as a developer of some sort since 1997.  
I used to mainly do web development but in my current job it's mostly desktop applications.

I started this site primarily as a way of getting better at writing.

Also, I'm bad at writing about myself. Hopefully I'll improve.
